Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Lisa Zhao, a senior at the University of California, Berkeley, where I'm pursuing a dual degree in Statistics and Economics. My journey in academia has been guided by my passion for leveraging data analysis in decision-making processes. 

Committed to personal and professional growth, I actively seek out opportunities to hone my skills and broaden my horizons. Whether it's through internships, research projects, or networking endeavors, I am committed to continually evolving and learning. I'm always eager to collaborate and engage with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for data-driven solutions in finance and beyond. Feel free to reach out!

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm an avid traveler, always eager to explore new cities and immerse myself in different cultures. I also have a keen interest in fashion, photography, and design, finding inspiration in the creative expressions that surround us.
