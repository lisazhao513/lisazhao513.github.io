**Research Experience**  
Research Assistant | University of California, Berkeley — _Berkeley, CA_
* _September 2024 - Present_
  * Collaborated with Afras Sial (Econ PhD candidate) to analyze the impact of earned wage access on low-income workers using IV, event study, and staggered differences-in-differences designs. Created visualizations to present findings on a data set of 1.2 million rows. 
  * Assisted Luisa Cefala (Haas Post-Doc) in analyzing the economic effects of "knowledge hoarding" through a field experiment across 120+ villages in Burundi.
